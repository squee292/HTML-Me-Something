        <h3>About the game</h3>
          <p>"The Age of Sigmar began with the thunderous arrival of the Stormcast Eternals, borne upon the heavenly storm of the God-King Sigmar.<br>
          Great heroes, snatched up at the moment of death and magically reforged, the sought vengeance on the followers of darkness, and the re-taking of the realms from Chaos.<br> 
          Yet in Shyish, the Realm of Death, the dark sorcery of Nagash, Supreme Lord of the Undead aims to transform the Mortal Realms into an ordered empire of mindless thralls.<br> 
          This is a new epoch, a time of mighty battles and unending war. This is the Age of Sigmar!<br>
          <br>
          The Age of Sigmar is an epic setting populated by myriad armies, powerful heroes and magnificent monsters.<br> 
          It plays host to vast, realm-spanning wars between the forces of Order and Chaos, Death and Destruction.<br> 
          In the Warhammer Age of Sigmar Core Book, you’ll not only learn the rich history of this war-torn Age,<br> 
          but you’ll find all the rules you need in order to evoke these epic stories on the tabletop." - Games Workshop</p>

        <h3> Preping the model</h3>
          <p>When starting a new miniature, you first must remove the pieces from a sprue. Below is an image of what the sprue looks like.<br>

          After removing the pieces I would then glue them together to get them ready to prime and paint.</p>

        <h3>Assembiling and Painting</h3>
          <p>After assembling the pieces, I then would prime the model and get them ready to paint. I start with a base color, <br>
            in this case brown as the model is mostly wood. I then painted the metal parts a burnish gold so that when I shade <br>
            the model, they turn out a bronze color. <br>
            <img src="./image/frames_started.jpg" alt="Painted pieces" height="300" width="500"><br>
            I then used a technique called dry brushing to highlight the grains <br>
            in the wood so they stand out more.</p>
