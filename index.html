        <h3>About the game</h3>
        <p>"The Age of Sigmar began with the thunderous arrival of the Stormcast Eternals, borne upon the heavenly storm of the God-King Sigmar.<br>
          Great heroes, snatched up at the moment of death and magically reforged, the sought vengeance on the followers of darkness, and the re-taking of the realms from Chaos.<br> 
          Yet in Shyish, the Realm of Death, the dark sorcery of Nagash, Supreme Lord of the Undead aims to transform the Mortal Realms into an ordered empire of mindless thralls.<br> 
          This is a new epoch, a time of mighty battles and unending war. This is the Age of Sigmar!<br>
          <br>
          The Age of Sigmar is an epic setting populated by myriad armies, powerful heroes and magnificent monsters.<br> 
          It plays host to vast, realm-spanning wars between the forces of Order and Chaos, Death and Destruction.<br> 
          In the Warhammer Age of Sigmar Core Book, you’ll not only learn the rich history of this war-torn Age,<br> 
          but you’ll find all the rules you need in order to evoke these epic stories on the tabletop." - Games Workshop</p>
